### pd.where || .loc[] | mask() | map()

For my [Medium article][https://medium.com/@AKayode_research/pd-where-the-titanic-loc-masking-mapping-5af2a1b50c61] || an attempt at chained/nested pd.where() ... A walkthrough for my Medium article

This is a follow-up to my previous [Medium](https://medium.com/@AKayode_research/np-where-the-titanic-83bdc0a16b11) post,  
where I successfully attempted using ***np.where*** in imputing missing NaN/null value. The trick is the *nested np.where*  

NB: Here, I used a dynamically generated data as a proxy for the #titanic dataset.
